User-specific-deals-using-Groupon-API
=====================================
Find deals for the user's location using Groupon API and Google locations and Google Maps API. Then a list view and a map view was provided for all the deals on two separate tabs. The user could also change the location using a drop down menu. Again here a wishlist was provided to store user specific deals. A login page was created to enter the App and the user was authenticated based on his credentials stored in Parse.com
